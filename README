DON'T modify ***Main.storyboard***
Check new branch, write code and commit, DON'T directly in master branch.

######################################
Modify any other storyboard file to add/modify view controller or view.

if you want to add group(yello)/folder(blue), please first create folder in
Finder and drag it into project. Discuz with me would be better.

** Change Main Interface from Main.storyboard to Login.storyboard after Login
feature finished.

** Use InputHelper to dismiss keyboard.
